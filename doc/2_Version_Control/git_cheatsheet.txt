1. git commit

What it does:
Saves (records) the staged changes in your local repository as a new commit.
Common arguments:

-m "message" → Adds a commit message directly from the command line.

-a → Automatically stages all modified, tracked files before committing.

--amend → Modifies the most recent commit (e.g., to change the message or add forgotten changes).
Changes with arguments:
Yes — with --amend, it edits the previous commit instead of creating a new one.

2. git branch

What it does:
Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
Common arguments:

(no arguments) → Lists all local branches.

<branch_name> → Creates a new branch with the given name.

-d <branch_name> → Deletes a branch.

-m <old_name> <new_name> → Renames a branch.
Changes with arguments:
Yes — behavior changes depending on arguments: listing, creating, deleting, or renaming branches.

3. git checkout

What it does:
Switches between branches or restores files.
Common arguments:

<branch_name> → Switches to an existing branch.

-b <branch_name> → Creates and switches to a new branch.

<file_name> → Restores a file to its last committed version.
Changes with arguments:
Yes — it can either change branches or revert files depending on what arguments you provide.

4. git pull

What it does:
Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
Common arguments:

<remote> (e.g., origin) → Specifies which remote to pull from.

<branch> → Specifies which branch to pull.

--rebase → Rebase instead of merge after fetching.
Changes with arguments:
Mostly the same core function (update your branch), but using --rebase changes how history is applied.

5. git push

What it does:
Uploads your local commits to a remote repository.
Common arguments:

<remote> <branch> → Pushes a specific branch (e.g., git push origin main).

-u → Sets the upstream branch for future pushes.

--force or -f → Forces the push (overwrites remote history — use with caution).
Changes with arguments:
Slightly — you can define which branch/remote to push to, or overwrite history with --force.

6. git merge

What it does:
Combines changes from another branch into the current branch.
Common arguments:

<branch_name> → Merges the specified branch into the current one.

--no-ff → Forces a merge commit, even if a fast-forward merge is possible.

--abort → Cancels a merge in progress.
Changes with arguments:
No major function change — always merges, but options modify how it merges.

7. git rebase

What it does:
Moves or reapplies commits on top of another base commit or branch.
Common arguments:

<branch_name> → Rebase current branch onto another branch.

-i (interactive) → Lets you edit, squash, or reorder commits.

--continue, --abort → Manage ongoing rebase.
Changes with arguments:
Yes — interactive mode (-i) significantly changes its use (manual editing of commits).

8. git fetch

What it does:
Downloads commits, branches, and tags from a remote repository without merging them into your local branch.
Common arguments:

<remote> → Fetch from a specific remote.

<remote> <branch> → Fetch a specific branch.

--all → Fetch from all remotes.
Changes with arguments:
No — still retrieves updates, but scope (which remote/branch) changes.
