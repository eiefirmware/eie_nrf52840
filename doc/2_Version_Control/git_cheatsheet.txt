git commit
Description: commits the changes to your current branch into a new commit bubble, basically saving your work "locally" on git

git branch
Description: creates a new branch where you can commit changes independent of other branches

git checkout <branch_name>
Description: Switch to the branch named <branch_name>, allowing you to use all git commands under the new branch. If you type git checkout -b <branch_name> it will create that branch and switch you to it in one step

git pull
Description: Will fetch all changes from the currently selected branch from its cloud version, then merge your current branch with the online repository origin/<branch_name>. If you do git pull --rebase it will pull your files and then rebase instead of merge. Also you can use git pull <remote> <branch>


git push
Pushes changes onto the remote repository.
Using -u will create a remote repository on your github remote, for example git push -u origin will create a remote branch for your current branch. Consecutive git pushes dont need this, just the initialization for your remote repository.

git merge <branch_name>
merge current branch with branch <branch_name>

git rebase <branch_name>
Change the base of your current branch to the base of another branch <branch_name>

git fetch
fetch changes of your remote repository, changes are not stored locally but on your remote branch, to actually store the changes you do git merge origin/<branch_name>

git add <directory>
Description: moves changes from your working directory to the staging area (also called index), basically "include these files in next commit". Note directory starts where your current directory is.

fun stuff: git add doc/ will add all files to staging area inside <current_directory>/doc/...

git status
Description: Answers the following questions
What branch am I on?

What changes have I made?

Which changes are staged for commit?

Which changes are unstaged or untracked?

Is my branch ahead/behind the remote?


git log
Description: log of all the commit history of the repository, starting from most recent commit.

git diff
Description: will show you all the changes in your current repository. Shows stuff you have changed but not put into the staging area.
